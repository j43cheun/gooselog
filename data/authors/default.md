# Hello. I'm Justin.

I'm a software developer based in the Greater Seattle Area in Washington State.

I'm currently working as a software developer at Microsoft on the Hyper-V
Resource Management and Security (RMS) Team. Prior to this, I was a software
developer on the Storage Spaces Dev Team at Microsoft, where I worked on storage
management and storage virtualization for Windows Client, Windows Server, and
Azure Stack HCI.

Outside of work, I enjoy photography and playing video games. My goto camera is
the Sony α7 IV and my favorite video games are the Pokémon main series titles
and Animal Crossing.

My favorite animal is the Canada Goose.
