Happy April Fools Day!

Normally, this would be the perfect day for a lighthearted prank; however, I
already feel like the fool this year being stuck in a 516 sqft space 24/7.

It also happens to be cherry blossom season. I took a walk outside two days ago
to take photos of the cherry blossom trees in bloom around downtown Redmond.
Now that it's spring, the weather has been getting nicer and the days have been
getting noticeably longer.

As for my COVID-19 quarantine situation, not much has changed from my last post.
My workplace has opened up partially as of March 31, 2021; however, I'm still
WFH to minimize my own risk of catching COVID-19. Governor Inslee recently
announced that COVID-19 vaccinnes would be opened up to those 16+ of age as of
mid-April, so I'm looking forward to getting my shot.

At work, I've been working on a lot of performance optimizations. At home, I've
been trying to pass the time by streaming a lot of content from YouTube,
Crunchyroll, and Disney+. I'm currently hooked on watching **The Falcon and the
Winter Soldier**.

I really miss the pre-pandemic days. WFH is okay once in a while, but a year's
worth of WFH is getting to me. Sometimes, I think I'm starting to lose my mind.
Maybe I need to take up a new hobby...
