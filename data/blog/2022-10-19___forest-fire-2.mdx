Looks like the air quality is getting worse in Washington State ðŸ¤¬. I don't
remember ever seeing the air quality this bad before.

It's supposed to rain on Friday, so hopefully, the rain knocks out the forest
fire.

In British Columbia, Canada, they've reportedly replaced Smokey Bear with Ember
the FireSmart Fox. Unlike Smokey, Ember the FireSmart Fox is supposed to
emphasize living with forest fires, since they are apparently natural
occurrences and it can be healthy to let the forest fire continue burning.

Still... I'd like the forest fire in Washington State to be over. It's probably
been raging for the past month.

Been stuck indoors playing PokÃ©mon XD Gale of Darkness...
