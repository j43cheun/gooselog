It's been a month since I've last updated this blog. So far, the past month of
April has been fairly lowkey. **The Falcon and the Winter Soldier** series
concluded with Sam Wilson becoming the next Captain America. Meanwhile, I'm
still quarantined at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic (which is somehow still
getting worse in certain parts of the world) and I've managed to get hooked on
seasonal anime (which is pretty run-of-the-mill for the month of April). Oh
yeah... and I'm fully vaccinated against COVID-19 now (or at least until a
booster shot is inevitably mandated later this year).

## COVID-19 Vaccine

In early April, I was fortunate enough to be able to secure an appointment for
COVID-19 vaccination with the **King County Vaccination Partnership** in
Redmond. If I recall correctly, appointment slots were very scarce. Places like
QFC ran out of appointment slots quickly and Costco's COVID-19 vaccination web
portal wouldn't even load. It took a few days after registration before I could
even schedule an appointment with the King County Vaccination Partnership in
Redmond for COVID-19 vaccination. I heard that the wait times are even longer
now.

During my appointments, I ended up receiving the **Pfizer-BioNTech** COVID-19
vaccine. I received my first dose in early April and my second dose earlier this
week.

### Side Effects

Before receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, I had heard on the news
that some people experienced some side effects ranging from soreness at the
injection site to nausea and fever. I had also heard that the side effects could
be more intense with the second dose, due to the body mounting an immune
response.

Luckily for me, the side effects I experienced were very mild. For both my first
and second doses, I only experienced soreness at the injection site and some
mild dehydration. YMMV.

Unfortunately, my iPhone wasn't spontaneously updated with 5G support after
vaccination :(

### Ontario, Canada

Back in 2020, I fully expected that Canada would be ahead of the US in COVID-19
vaccinations due to the political climate in the US at the time. Evidently,
things panned out very differently. Unlike in the US, Canada appears to have
prioritized administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to as many
people as possible vs. reserving two doses for each person. I find it ironic
that my parents, being in their 60s, have only received their first doses, while
my younger brother and I have both received our second doses.

## Seasonal Anime

As with every year, the month of April marks the start of the Spring anime
season. These are some of the shows I'm watching this season:

- Digimon Adventure (2020)
- Godzilla Singular Point
- Edens Zero
- I've Been Killing Slimes For 300 Years And Maxed Out My Level
- So I'm a Spider, So What?
- The Slime Diaries

### Digimon Adventure (2020)

I grew up watching the original **Digimon Adventure** series. This series has
the same characters, but is set in a different universe. I'm watching this
mainly because of the characters.

### Godzilla Singular Point

I started watching this series because it had a catchy ending theme. I don't
really understand what's going on so far...

### Edens Zero

The manga for this series is written by the same author that wrote **Fairy
Tail**. The plot and world-building sounds interesting and I'm looking forward
to seeing how things will unravel in the upcoming episodes.

### I've Been Killing Slimes For 300 Years And Maxed Out My Level

A slice-of-life about a career woman who dies from overwork and is reincarnated
into a fantasy world as a witch and inadvertently maxes out her level after
killing slime monsters daily for 300 years. A good watch for unwinding after a
stressful week.

### So I'm a Spider, So What?

The show is about someone who reincarnates as a spider monster in a fantasy
world and goes on adventures. At first, I thought the premise was kind of dumb,
but the spider, plot and world building ended up being interesting.

### The Slime Diaries

This is a spinoff of **That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime**. The latter
series is about a salaryman who reincarnates into a fantasy world as a slime
monster with human-intellect that becomes OP and gains a lot of allies. This
spinoff series is a slice-of-life revolving around the same characters from the
parent series. Another good watch for unwinding after a stressful week.

## What Else?

I've started jogging more regularly as of April. At first, I started jogging 30
minutes per day (x3 10 minute jogs). Later, I increased the duration to 45
minutes (x3 15 minute jogs). Admittedly, my jogging schedule has been less
regular this week due to my second COVID-19 vaccine appointment and my own
laziness.

For the next month, I would like to get back to jogging regularly again (so that
I can get back to a normal BMI). I would also like to start doing my own grocery
shopping again now that I'm fully vaccinated (previously, I was using
Instacart).
